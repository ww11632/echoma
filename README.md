# Echoma - Emotional Encryption Chain

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/echoma-logo.png" alt="Echoma Logo" width="200">
  <h3>Zero-Knowledge Emotional Diary on Sui</h3>
  <p><em>Your emotions, encrypted forever. Your privacy, guaranteed on-chain.</em></p>
</div>

[中文版本](./README.zh.md)

**Echoma** is the first Web3-native emotional journaling app that treats user privacy as a first-class citizen. We combine production-grade client-side encryption, decentralized storage via Walrus, and blockchain attestations on Sui to ensure that sensitive emotional data remains private yet permanently verifiable.

**One-line pitch:** *"We encrypt your emotions before they leave your device, store them on decentralized Walrus, and prove their existence with NFTs on Sui—all while maintaining zero-knowledge privacy."*

**Key innovation:** Emotional data as a revocable, verifiable, zero-knowledge primitive on Sui.

**Note:** Zero-knowledge here refers to a platform-zero-knowledge property via end-to-end encryption, not a zk-SNARK computation proof.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters for DATA SECURITY & PRIVACY

### The Problem
Emotional and mental health data is among the **most sensitive personal information**, yet current solutions fail users:
-  **Traditional apps**: Centralized servers can be hacked, seized, or monetized
-  **Web3 alternatives**: Store plaintext data on IPFS/Arweave—anyone with the CID can read it
-  **Privacy laws**: GDPR/CCPA require user data sovereignty, but platforms don't deliver

### Our Solution: Four-Layer Defense

- **Layer 1:** Client-side cryptography (Argon2id → AES-GCM)
- **Layer 2:** Encrypted blobs on Walrus
- **Layer 3:** NFT attestations on Sui
- **Layer 4:** Seal-based grant/revoke governance

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**Echoma only offers journaling and general emotional support. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice.**

The app helps you track how you feel, but it does not provide medical diagnoses, treatment plans, or emergency services. Please contact qualified healthcare professionals whenever you have mental-health or medical needs.

---

## 🔬 Technical Innovation Highlights

### 1. Memory-Hard Key Derivation (Argon2id v3.0)
**Problem:** Traditional PBKDF2 is vulnerable to GPU/ASIC attacks  
**Solution:** Argon2id with 64MB memory requirement

```typescript
// Production parameters
iterations: 3
memorySize: 64 * 1024  // 64 MB
parallelism: 4
hashLength: 32
```

**Security Impact:**
- ✅ +300% GPU resistance vs PBKDF2
- ✅ +500% ASIC resistance
- ✅ Automatic fallback to enhanced PBKDF2 (300k iterations) for unsupported devices

📖 [Full technical details](./ARGON2ID_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md)

### 2. Dynamic On-Chain Access Control (Seal Policies)
**Problem:** Traditional NFT ownership = full access (inflexible)  
**Solution:** Sui's Seal framework enables programmable privacy

**Use Cases:**
- Share diary with therapist for 30 days
- Grant family emergency access
- Revoke permissions after therapy ends

📖 [Seal Policies Guide](./SEAL_POLICIES_USER_GUIDE.md)

### 3. Hybrid Storage Architecture
**Authenticated Mode:** Supabase (metadata) + Walrus (encrypted blobs)  
**Anonymous Mode:** Pure Walrus + Sui (no centralized components)  
**MVP Mode:** Local IndexedDB (offline-first)

**Why this matters:**
- Users choose their privacy/convenience trade-off
- No vendor lock-in
- Graceful degradation if Walrus is congested

### 4. Production-Ready Security Test Suite
We have **measurable security validation**:

```bash
✅ Test 1: Argon2id Key Derivation [PASS]
✅ Test 2: AES-GCM-256 Encryption [PASS]
✅ Test 3: Backward Compatibility (v1→v2 migration) [PASS]
✅ Test 4: Password Change & Re-encryption [PASS]
✅ Test 5: Cross-Device Sync Integrity [PASS]
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

### Client-Side Encryption Flow
```
User Password/Wallet
    ↓
Argon2id (3 iter × 64MB) → Master Key
    ↓
AES-GCM-256 → Encrypted Diary Entry
    ↓
Walrus.store(blob) → Blob ID
    ↓
Sui NFT(blob_id, timestamp) → On-Chain Proof
```

### Data Sovereignty Guarantee
```
❌ Platform CANNOT:
  - Read diary content (encrypted)
  - Access user keys (client-side only)
  - Prevent user withdrawal (Walrus is permissionless)
  - Modify historical records (blockchain immutability)

✅ User CAN:
  - Export all data anytime
  - Delete cloud metadata (Walrus blob persists if paid)
  - Change encryption passwords
  - Self-host the entire stack
```


#### Core Contrast: Why Echoma is a New Privacy Primitive

| Dimension | Lens | Echoma |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Data Type** | Public social content | Private encrypted emotional data |
| **Graph** | Social graph | Inner emotional graph |
| **Storage** | IPFS plaintext + on-chain metadata | Walrus encrypted blobs + Sui metadata |
| **Access** | Modules for public rules | Modules for revocable privacy rules |
| **Composability** | Default open | Consent-gated open |
| **Permanence** | Immutable public history | Revocable governance + key disappearance |

**One-line takeaway:** Lens gives us the architecture for composable data objects; Echoma adds the missing layer: consent-based, revocable, zero-knowledge governance for the most sensitive human data.

---

---

## 🌐 Network Configuration

**Default network: Sui Mainnet**

- Switch between Testnet and Mainnet via the UI (top-right corner)
- Network preference persists across sessions and syncs across tabs
- Automatic Walrus endpoint switching (testnet/mainnet)
- Network-aware data handling with cross-network record access

⚠️ **Note:** Walrus aggregator on testnet may occasionally fail to serve downloads (data remains on-chain and visible on SuiScan).

📖 See [WALRUS_SETUP.md](./WALRUS_SETUP.md) for Walrus storage duration (epochs) details.

---

## 💧 Test Tokens

Walrus uploads require **SUI** and **WAL** tokens on testnet.

**Test Credentials:**
- Testnet Faucet: [Sui Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/)
- Walrus Faucet: [WAL Tokens](https://discord.gg/walrus)

📖 See [Faucet Test Token Guide](./Faucet_Test_Token_Guide.md) for faucet links and walkthroughs.

## 💡 Real-World Impact

### Target Users
1. **Mental health patients** seeking HIPAA/GDPR-compliant journaling
2. **Privacy-conscious individuals** in oppressive regimes
3. **Web3 natives** wanting sovereign personal data
4. **Therapists** needing secure client communication channels

### Why This Matters

Mental health data breaches have **real consequences**:
- In 2023, therapy platform BetterHelp paid $7.8M for selling patient data
- In 2023, HIPAA-reportable breaches exposed ~133M+ healthcare records
- Depression/anxiety journals used for insurance discrimination

Sources in [THREAT_MODEL_EN.md](./THREAT_MODEL_EN.md).

**Echoma proves Web3 can fix this.** By putting privacy *before* features and *sovereignty before convenience*, we show that blockchain isn't just for DeFi—it's for **human dignity**.

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Three Modes

Echoma offers three flows tailored to different needs.

#### 1. Anonymous Mode (Wallet Mode)
- **Routes:** `/record`, `/timeline`
- **Best for:** Decentralized storage without accounts
- **Quick steps:** Connect wallet → Record emotion → Choose Walrus storage (select epochs) → Enable "Mint as NFT" → Record & Mint
- **Features:**
  - Optional AI emotion analysis (3 requests/min, no login)
  - Walrus storage with configurable retention (1–1000 epochs, ~1 day each)
  - NFT minting: **Unlimited** on both Testnet and Mainnet (contract supports multiple mints per day)
  - Automatic Journal creation, transaction tracking, Timeline badges

#### 2. Authenticated Mode (Secure Mode)
- **Routes:** `/auth-record`, `/auth-timeline`
- **Best for:** Multi-device access and AI-powered journaling
- **Features:** Supabase login, cloud backup, AI analysis (10 requests/min), realtime sync across devices

#### 3. MVP Mode (Local Mode)
- **Routes:** `/mvp`, `/mvp-timeline`
- **Best for:** Quick demos, offline use, no wallet/login required
- **Features:** Fully local storage, AES-GCM 256 encryption, automatic key management

### Timeline Experience

**Features:**
- Search, filter (tags, dates, storage), and sort entries
- Bulk operations (export/delete)
- Data export (CSV/JSON/PDF/Markdown) with custom fields and date formats
- Emotion analytics (distribution, trends, forecasts, correlation, calendar)
- Virtualized scrolling (smooth with 1000+ entries)
- Auto-decrypt for local and public Walrus entries
- Manual decrypt retry for private entries
- Supabase Realtime sync (authenticated mode only)

### AI Emotion Analysis

Available in both Anonymous and Authenticated modes.

- Warm, empathetic responses in English or Traditional Chinese
- Rate limits: 3/min (anonymous), 10/min (authenticated)
- Safety features: prompt injection controls, crisis detection, audit logging

---

## 🔑 Password Management

Echoma now supports user-defined encryption passwords for enhanced security.

### Features

- **Custom passwords** – Set your own encryption password (recommended for stronger security than wallet-only encryption)
- **First-time setup** – Optional password setup dialog on first use (can be skipped)
- **Password reset** – Change your password and automatically re-encrypt all data
- **Session caching** – Password cached for 15 minutes to reduce repeated input
- **Password hints** – Optional hints stored locally (plaintext) to help you remember
- **Key versioning** – Automatic version tracking and migration support

### How It Works

1. **Initial Setup** (Optional)
   - On first use, you'll be prompted to set an encryption password
   - You can skip and set it later
   - Password requirements: minimum 8 characters with letters and numbers/symbols

2. **Password Reset**
   - Enter your old password to verify
   - Set a new password
   - All local data is automatically re-encrypted with the new password

3. **Data Migration**
   - Automatic migration from v1 (wallet/user ID only) to v2 (with password)
   - Backward compatible - old data can still be accessed
   - Key version tracking prevents incompatibility issues

### Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:**
- Your password is **never stored or uploaded** anywhere
- If you forget your password, you **cannot** decrypt your data
- Use a password manager or write down your password hint
- Password only applies to local/MVP mode data (not Walrus-stored data)
