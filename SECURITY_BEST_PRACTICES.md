# Encryption Security Best Practices Audit Report

## ✅ Best Practices Already Implemented

### 1. **Encryption Algorithm Selection**
- ✅ Uses **AES-GCM 256-bit** (industry standard, provides encryption and authentication)
- ✅ IV length = 12 bytes (AES-GCM requirement)
- ✅ Each encryption uses unique random IV (prevents IV reuse attacks)

### 2. **Key Derivation (KDF)**
- ✅ **Prioritize Argon2id** (memory-hard, resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks)
  - Time cost: 3 iterations
  - Memory cost: 64 MB (65536 KB)
  - Parallelism: 4 threads
- ✅ **Automatic Fallback to Enhanced PBKDF2** (if WASM unavailable)
  - Iterations: 300k - 1M (auto-adjusted based on device performance)
  - Uses SHA-256 hash algorithm
- ✅ Complete WASM integration with fallback design

### 3. **Salt Management**
- ✅ Uses random salt for encryption (≥16 bytes)
- ✅ Each encryption uses unique salt
- ✅ Key generation uses deterministic salt (based on application + user identifier)
- ✅ Salt stored in encryption header, supports decryption

### 4. **IV/Nonce Management**
- ✅ Each encryption generates new random IV
- ✅ IV length strictly validated (12 bytes)
- ✅ IV stored in encryption header

### 5. **Versioning and Backward Compatibility**
- ✅ Versioned encryption header (supports future algorithm upgrades)
- ✅ Automatic migration of old format data
- ✅ Clear version number management

### 6. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Clear error classification (key errors, data corruption, etc.)
- ✅ AES-GCM authentication tag strictly validated
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Does not leak sensitive information (such as key content)

### 7. **Key Management**
- ✅ Warns about risks of generating keys from low-entropy sources (address/ID)
- ✅ Supports user password/passphrase input (recommended)
- ✅ Deterministic key generation (same input produces same key)

### 8. **Code Quality**
- ✅ TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Clear comments and documentation
- ✅ Input validation (password non-empty, format checks, etc.)

## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Key Generation Security** (Fixed)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Key generation now uses deterministic salt
- ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Future should require user password/passphrase input, not just rely on address/ID

### 2. **Argon2id Integration** (✅ Completed)
- ✅ **Current status**: Fully integrated Argon2id WASM (using hash-wasm library)
- ✅ **Smart Fallback**: Automatically detects WASM availability, uses enhanced PBKDF2 on failure
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Includes complete error handling and performance optimization
- ✅ **Security parameters**: Follows OWASP recommendations (3 iterations × 64 MB × 4 threads)

### 3. **Constant-Time Operations** (Low Priority)
- ℹ️ **Note**: Web Crypto API implementations are usually constant-time
- ⚠️ **Attention**: If manual comparison functions are needed in the future, should use constant-time comparison

### 4. **Key Storage** (Application Layer Consideration)
- ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Consider implementing key backup and recovery mechanisms
- ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Consider multi-device sync solutions (requires secure key sharing)

### 5. **Password Strength Requirements** (Future Enhancement)
- ⚠️ **Recommendation**: If user password input is implemented, should add password strength checks
- ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Consider implementing password complexity requirements

## 🔒 Security Features Summary

### Core Security Measures Implemented

1. **Client-Side Encryption**
   - Data encrypted before leaving device
   - Server cannot see plaintext

2. **Strong Key Derivation**
   - PBKDF2 adaptive iterations (100k-1M)
   - Supports Argon2id (interface reserved)

3. **Uniqueness Guarantee**
   - Each encryption uses unique random salt and IV
   - Same content produces different encrypted results

4. **Integrity Verification**
   - AES-GCM automatically verifies authentication tag
   - Detects data tampering

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Versioned encryption header
   - Automatic migration of old formats
